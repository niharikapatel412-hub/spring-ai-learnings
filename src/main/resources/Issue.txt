Issue faced during the development.

1. Upload controller not handling large file uploads properly.
   Solution: Added below paramatrs in application.properties
    spring.servlet.multipart.max-file-size=200MB
    spring.servlet.multipart.max-request-size=200MB

2. The load api was taking too long to process the any other pdf than the article.pdf
    Error logs :
    "java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Document outline (e.g. TOC) is null.
     Make sure the PDF document has a table of contents (TOC).
  Solution : Used PagePdfDocumentReader instead of ParagraphPdfDocumentReader.

3. API took very long to process the pdf upload
    Solution : Added @Async to the upload method in FileUploadController.java
    and enabled async processing in main application class with @EnableAsync annotation.
